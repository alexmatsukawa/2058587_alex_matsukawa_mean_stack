STEPS:

1.) Open two command terminals and run the command 'mongod' and 'mongo' in separate terminals.
	-> NOTE: If the mongodb directory was not added as a path variable, you will need to open the terminal in the folder where the mongodb version bin is located on your machine.
2.) In the terminal where 'mongo' was ran, run the command 'use tcs_mean' to switch to the tcs_mean database.
3.) In the same terminal, run the command 'db.createCollection("callRecord")' to create a new collection where the call records will be stored.
4.) Next, run the command 'db.call-record.insertMany({json-data}])' to insert all the call records located in the json file. 
	-> NOTE: json-data is a placeholder identifier which refers to the actual json data stored in the call records json file.
5.) OPTIONAL: Run the command 'db.callRecord.find()' to make sure all the json data was added to the desired collection correctly.
